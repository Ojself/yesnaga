## About Yesnaga

Yesnaga  has a hexagonal playing area composed of 19 rings, with each player having three pieces that start in alternating vertices around the hexagon. On a turn, a player must do two things, in order:

- Move one of their pieces in a straight line up to the end of the board or up to colliding with another piece
- Move one of the exterior empty rings to another location on the playing area where it touches two rings.

Whoever first manages to connect their three pieces wins!
