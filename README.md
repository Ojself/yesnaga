# YESNAGA

## About
Yesnaga is inspired by Nonaga, a board game created by [Viktor Bautista i Roca](https://twitter.com/viktorbir) and distributed by Steffen Spiele.

The game has a hexagonal playing area composed of 19 discs, with each player having three moveable tokens, that start in alternating vertices around the hexagon. Every turn, a player must do two things, in order:

- Move one of their tokens in a straight line up to the end of the board or up to colliding with another token
- Move one of the exterior empty discs to another location on the playing area where it touches at least two discs.

Whoever first manages to connect their three tokens wins!
